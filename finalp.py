# Atticus Patrick and Owen Patrick

# This program is a tool that can be used to analyze Premier League soccer player data from 2014/15 to 2018/19.
# The data points that this programs reads in come from a soccer statistics website Understat.com. We have created text
# files unique to 20 different players with data points extracted from this website to be read into the program. The
# program reads in data about a user specified player, including years played (2014/15 to 2018/19), appearances
# made, goals scored, assists, expected goals, and expected assists (as a reminder, expected goals and assists are
# statistics in soccer calculated based on a number of factors, such as the angle towards the goal and proximity to the
# goal, describing the statistical likelihood of a certain shot becoming a goal or a certain pass becoming an assist).
# It then gives the option for the user to see a summary of the player's statistics, a bar graph of goals vs expected
# goals for each year, and finally a bar graph of assists vs expected assists for each year.
